# Cluster API Provider Docker (CAPD)

## Infrastrucutre provider for testing/development

This project is an infrastructure provider for the [Cluster API](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api) project.

It is incomplete by itself and requires the core provider (types + controller) and a bootstrap provider (types + controller).

To get a complete overview, look at the documentation in the bootstrap provider that uses CAPD as an example infrastructure provider.
