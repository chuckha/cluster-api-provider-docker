# Cluster API Provider Docker (CAPD)

CAPD is a reference implementation of an infrastructure provider for the Cluster API project using Docker.

This is one out of three components needed to run a Cluster API management cluster.

For a complete overview, please refer to the documentation available [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-bootstrap-provider-kubeadm#cluster-api-bootstrap-provider-kubeadm) which uses CAPD as an example infrastructure provider.

## CAPD Goals

* To be a the reference implementation of an infrastructure provider.
* The code is highly trusted and used in testing of ClusterAPI.
* This provider can be used as a guide for developers looking to implement their own infrastructure provider.
